   Window of the CSV importer.

To import a file we will first have to select in the dropdown *Import type* the type of 
file to import.

Next, we will select the file by clicking on the search button in the *File* section.

Next, we will configure the importer specifying the character encoding (*Set of characters*),
if we ignore the headers of the file (*Ignore headers*), which is the separator (*Delimiter*), as
well as which is the decimal separator.
