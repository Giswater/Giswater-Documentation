    Window of the New planning sector tool.

To create a new psector we will have to click on the *New psector* button and a window like the one shown in the previous image will open. In it we will have to specify, at least, the name.

After having created it it will be set as the current psector. **From that moment on, any object that we digitize in our network will be in the planned state**.

Parallelly, we can check that all the buttons corresponding to the editing of the network objects have changed to orange color.
