Fuse Arc
=============

Tool that allows fusing two existing arcs into a single arc.

.. warning::

    The two arcs to fuse must have the same catalog. If not, the fusion will not be performed.

After clicking on the tool button and selecting the node through which the fusion will be performed, a window will appear where we will have to select what action to perform on the node 
(keep it operational, deactivate it or delete it).

After the fusion, a summary window will appear with information about the process.
