    Window of the Date Selector tool.

Once the start and end dates are established, the change will be applied to the *selector_date* table in the database for our user.

With this tool, users can create queries or views on temporal data and relate them to the *selector_date* table.
Once these queries are loaded as layers in QGIS, they can be filtered dynamically thanks to this button, which can offer a great added value to the visualization 
of certain data on the map.
