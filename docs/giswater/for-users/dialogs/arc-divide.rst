Divide Arc
============

Tool that allows dividing an existing arc with a node, generating two new arcs, always that the node has value *true* in the *isarcdivide* field in the *Node feature catalog*.

There are two options available:

- Drag-Drop: allows moving a node that is disconnected from the network over the arc we want to divide.
- Selected: allows selecting a disconnected node that is already on the arc to divide.

After performing the operation, a summary window will appear with information about the operation carried out.
