Window of the Manage Visit tool.

The form contains a table with all the visits performed in the project as well as their data.

From here we can open or delete a visit using the corresponding buttons as well as create a new one. We can also filter by the *ext_code* field.

In those cases where a visit has geometry, we can also open it using the *Info Giswater* button.
