Insert objects
================

When we find ourselves in a new project without data, the first thing we have to do before starting to digitalize the network objects is to fill in the mandatory catalogs and create the minimum map zones (macroexploitation, exploitation, sector and municipality).

After this, we can digitalize objects using the *Insert point* and *Insert arc* tools.

.. warning::

   Before starting to digitalize we have to configure **mandatorily** the autoassembly options.

To digitalize a point we will click on the map in its location, after which its form will appear to enter the corresponding data.

To digitalize an arc we will click on its initial node and, subsequently, on its final node. After this, its form will open as it does for the node and we will enter its data.

If we have not configured the autoassembly options or we have not configured them correctly, we will not be able to insert the object and Giswater will show an error.

.. important::

   When inserting a new object, we have to introduce information about its catalog at least.
   If there is any other mandatory field that we have not filled in, Giswater will show us a warning and we will see the field to be completed marked in the form with a red rectangle.

Edit objects
==============

To edit the information of a network object we will use the *Info Giswater* button to open its form and, putting it in edit mode, we will modify the corresponding data.

If it is necessary to perform a massive editing of some data, it can be done through its attribute table.
